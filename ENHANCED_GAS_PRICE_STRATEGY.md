# Enhanced Gas Price Strategy for High-Fee Networks

## Problem
The W-Chain testnet requires significantly higher gas prices than typical networks, causing "transaction underpriced" errors even with 110 gwei gas prices.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Aggressive Gas Price Strategy
- **Minimum Gas Price**: 100 gwei (increased from 1 gwei)
- **Maximum Gas Price**: 10,000 gwei (increased from 1,000 gwei)
- **Buffer**: 20% above network price for high-fee networks

### 2. Automatic Retry with Higher Gas Price
- If transaction fails with "underpriced" error
- Automatically retry with 2x the gas price
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Fallback Strategy
- Multiple gas price calculation methods
- Progressive fallback from aggressive to reasonable
- Network-specific optimization

## Gas Price Tiers

| Strategy | Minimum | Maximum | Buffer | Use Case |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| Aggressive | 100 gwei | 10,000 gwei | 20% | High-fee networks like W-Chain |
| Reasonable | 1 gwei | 1,000 gwei | 10% | Standard networks |
| Fallback | 200 gwei | 200 gwei | 0% | Network errors |

## Implementation Details

### Aggressive Gas Price Function
```typescript
private static async getAggressiveGasPrice(): Promise<bigint> {
  const currentGasPrice = await this.publicClient.getGasPrice();
  const minGasPrice = parseEther("0.0000001"); // 100 gwei minimum
  const maxGasPrice = parseEther("0.00001"); // 10000 gwei maximum
  
  let gasPrice = currentGasPrice;
  
  // Ensure minimum for high-fee networks
  if (gasPrice < minGasPrice) {
    gasPrice = minGasPrice;
  }
  
  // Cap extremely high prices
  if (gasPrice > maxGasPrice) {
    gasPrice = maxGasPrice;
  }
  
  // Add 20% buffer for high-fee networks
  return (gasPrice * 120n) / 100n;
}
```

### Automatic Retry Logic
```typescript
// If "underpriced", try with even higher gas price
if (error.message.includes("underpriced")) {
  console.warn("Transaction underpriced, trying with higher gas price...");
  
  // Try with 2x the current gas price
  gasPrice = gasPrice * 2n;
  
  // Retry transaction with higher gas price
  const hash = await walletClient.sendTransaction(transaction);
}
```

## Benefits

### For High-Fee Networks
- **Successful Transactions**: Handles networks requiring high gas prices
- **Automatic Adaptation**: Retries with higher gas price if needed
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses minimum viable gas price

### For Users
- **Transparent Process**: Clear logging of gas price decisions
- **Automatic Recovery**: No manual intervention needed
- **Reasonable Costs**: Caps prevent excessive fees

## Network-Specific Optimization

### W-Chain Testnet Characteristics
- Requires gas prices > 100 gwei
- Network gas price varies significantly
- Benefits from aggressive pricing strategy

### Fallback Strategy
1. **Try Aggressive**: 100 gwei minimum, 20% buffer
2. **If Underpriced**: Double the gas price and retry
3. **If Still Fails**: Use 200 gwei fallback
4. **Log Everything**: Detailed debugging information

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Console Logs
- Network gas price vs final gas price
- Retry attempts with higher gas prices
- Success/failure reasons

### Error Handling
- Specific "underpriced" error detection
- Automatic retry with higher gas price
- Clear error messages for users

This enhanced strategy ensures transactions succeed on high-fee networks while maintaining cost efficiency and providing excellent user experience.
