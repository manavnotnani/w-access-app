# Transaction Sponsorship System

## Problem
High gas prices on W-Chain testnet (2000+ gwei) make transactions extremely expensive, requiring 50+ ETH for gas fees alone. This makes transactions impractical for users.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automatic Transaction Sponsorship
- **Sponsorship Threshold**: Gas costs > 1 WCO trigger automatic sponsorship
- **Server Funding**: Uses existing funding service to cover gas costs
- **Transparent Process**: Users see when transactions are sponsored

### 2. Smart Balance Checking
- **Pre-Transaction Check**: Calculates total cost before attempting transaction
- **Sponsorship Decision**: Determines if sponsorship is needed
- **Balance Validation**: Ensures sufficient funds after sponsorship

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Real-Time Preview**: Shows sponsorship status in transaction preview
- **Clear Messaging**: Indicates when gas fees are sponsored
- **Cost Transparency**: Displays actual vs sponsored costs

## Implementation Details

### Sponsorship Logic
```typescript
private static shouldSponsorTransaction(gasCost: bigint, walletBalance: bigint, transactionValue: bigint): boolean {
  const gasCostInWCO = Number(formatEther(gasCost));
  
  // Sponsor if gas cost is more than 1 WCO (very expensive)
  return gasCostInWCO > 1.0;
}
```

### Transaction Flow
1. **Calculate Costs**: Estimate gas and total transaction cost
2. **Check Sponsorship**: Determine if gas costs exceed 1 WCO
3. **Sponsor if Needed**: Fund wallet with gas costs from server account
4. **Execute Transaction**: Proceed with normal transaction flow
5. **Return Results**: Include sponsorship information in response

### UI Enhancements
- **Transaction Preview**: Shows sponsorship status and costs
- **Sponsored Badge**: Visual indicator when gas fees are sponsored
- **Success Messages**: Indicates when transactions are sponsored
- **Real-Time Updates**: Calculates sponsorship info as user types

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Affordable Transactions**: No need to pay 50+ ETH for gas fees
- **Transparent Process**: Clear indication when transactions are sponsored
- **Seamless Experience**: Automatic sponsorship without user intervention

### For Platform
- **User Retention**: Removes barrier to transaction usage
- **Cost Control**: Only sponsors transactions above 1 WCO threshold
- **Scalable Solution**: Uses existing funding infrastructure

## Sponsorship Criteria

| Gas Cost | Action | User Pays |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| < 1 WCO | Normal transaction | Full cost |
| > 1 WCO | Sponsored transaction | Only transaction value |
